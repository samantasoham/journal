    <h1>A Diary of a Self-Taught Software/Web Developer</h1>
    <h2>Entry #1: Sept 1st, 2024</h2>
    <p> Today, when I got home, I collapsed onto the couch, reflecting on the work I do 
        and the satisfaction it brings—or rather, <strong><i>the things it takes away</i></strong>. 
        I couldn’t <b><em>shake</em></b> the frustration of missing out on my software and web development projects—some 
        <strong><i>I had promised</i></strong>, others were personal hobbies I had hoped to explore. 
        In that moment, I thought, <strong><i>enough is enough</i></strong>. It was time for a change. 
        That very day, while browsing the web for affordable resources, 
        I stumbled upon The Odin Project, reigniting the spark of my passion.
    </p>
    <h2>Entry #2: Sept 2nd, 2024</h2>
    <p> Even after sleeping on yesterday's idea, the burning desire for change didn’t fade.
        <em><b>So</b></em>, I grabbed a pen and started listing the pros and cons of my current job, mapping out the journey ahead.
        After much mental back-and-forth, I finally took the plunge and enrolled in The Odin Project.
        <em><b>With excitement coursing through me</b></em>, I opened the course, 
        ready to dive in—only to realize, unfortunately, that I had to head off to work.
    </p>
    <h2>Entry #3: Sept 3rd, 2024</h2>
    <p> <em><b>At last</b></em>, the moment I’d been waiting for arrived—I finally opened the course. 
        The first few topics might have seemed basic to some: an introduction to computers, 
        how the internet really works, and the distinction between a website and a webpage. 
        Each concept felt like a key unlocking the doors to a new realm of possibilities. 
        I could feel my excitement building with every line I <b><em>read</em></b>.
    </p>
    <p> <b><em>It wasn’t just about learning the basics</em></b>—it was about the thrill of stepping 
        into a world I had always dreamed of. With every click, 
        I was laying the groundwork for something bigger, 
        something more meaningful. <strong><i>This wasn’t just a course</i></strong>; it was the beginning of a 
        transformative journey. I felt an overwhelming sense of pride—I had finally taken the 
        first step into web and software development, a passion I had long <b><em>neglected</em></b>. 
        The road ahead felt unknown, yet thrilling, and I couldn’t wait to see where this adventure 
        would lead me.
    </p>
    <h2>Entry #4: Sept 4th, 2024</h2>
    <p> <strong><i>Today was a breakthrough</i></strong>—I successfully installed a virtual machine on my laptop! 
        But that wasn’t all. I went ahead and installed a Linux system on it as well. 
        The moment it booted up, <b><em>I couldn’t help but feel a surge of excitement</em></b> . 
        I was about to use an entirely different operating system, all while keeping my Windows setup 
        intact! It felt like I had unlocked a whole new dimension on my machine, 
        a playground for exploration and learning.
    </p>

    <p> The idea of seamlessly switching between two operating systems felt empowering. 
        It was as if I had expanded the capabilities of my laptop and, more importantly, 
        my own potential as a developer. I couldn’t wait to dive into Linux, tinker with its features, 
        and see how it would enhance my understanding of tech. Today wasn’t just about installing 
        software—it was about opening up new horizons in my journey. 
        And I could feel the excitement bubbling up for all the discoveries yet to come!
    </p>
    <h2>Entry #5: Sept 5th, 2024</h2>
    <p> I dove into the basics of Git and GitHub! Setting up my GitHub profile felt like 
        I was officially stepping into the world of developers, and connecting it to Git through the Linux 
        terminal? That felt like magic. The thrill of watching the terminal respond to my commands, 
        like creating directories, renaming files, and moving them from one folder to another—
        it all felt so empowering. Every line I typed was a step closer to mastering the tools 
        professionals use every day.
    </p>
    <p> And it didn’t stop there. I also installed VSCode, my new coding playground, 
        and learned the fundamentals of HTML. 
        Creating files and coding in VSCode made everything feel so real. 
        When I first encountered the concept of a boilerplate, it was like unlocking a secret formula, 
        and breaking down each part gave me a sense of control over my code. 
        The excitement of learning HTML tags—paragraphs, headings, italics, bold, and strong—
        was like discovering the building blocks of the web itself.
    </p>    
    <p> Right now, I’m using everything I’ve learned to write this very diary, and I can’t help but smile. 
        The fact that just a few hours ago, these skills were foreign to me, and now I’m putting them to use
        , feels surreal. This is only the beginning, and I can’t wait to see where this newfound 
        knowledge will take me next!
